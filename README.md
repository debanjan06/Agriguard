## 🎯 Problem Statement

Crop diseases cause 20-40% yield losses globally. Traditional detection methods rely on visual inspection after symptoms appear, making treatment less effective. AgriGuard provides **2-3 weeks early warning** using AI analysis of satellite and weather data.

## Key Achievements

- **97.5% Classification Accuracy** on multi-class disease detection
- **205 Real Sentinel-2 Images** processed via Google Earth Engine
- **Multi-Modal Architecture** combining satellite, spectral, and weather data
- **Production-Ready Deployment** with Docker containerization
- **Complete MLOps Pipeline** with MLflow tracking and monitoring
